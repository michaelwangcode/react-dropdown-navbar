# React Dropdown Navbar

This React project contains a Navigation Bar with a dropdown menu.

It is from the [React Navbar Dropdown Menu Responsive Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2MhVxJxsL0) by Brian Design.

### Code Updates

Changed `Switch` to `Routes` for the latest version of `react-router-dom`.

Changed the Route syntax from `<Route path="/" component={Home} />` to `<Route path='/' element={<Home/>} />`.

Added pages for Design and Development.

Added `padding-bottom: 100px` to the mobile `nav-menu` so links are displayed correctly.
